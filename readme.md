# Auth example

## What is this?

A really cut down, over-commented and incomplete app with some basic authentication for illustrative purposes

Seriously, don't use it as the basis for authenticating something serious.

## How do I use it?

- install node
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- run `keys.sh` to generate some local keys for ssh
- `npm run dev` to run it on https://localhost:3000
